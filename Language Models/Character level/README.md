### Abstract

oteta <br/>
qilornoe<br/>
sitorenn<br/>

yaoraoni<br/>
zeronaar<br/>

Overall, the results were quite underwhelming. I think the main reason could be one/all of the below :
1. The dataset is just weird. I agree Pokemon names are really cool but they don't really follow any trend and are mostly random alphabets with some vowels here and there.
2. I was too impatient and didn't train long enough (also quite plausible)

You could even use the weights of my model and train it further. Let me know if it results in better names!
