# Intro to NLP
 
My main motivation behind studying NLP was to mainly understand the architectural innovations of this field and apply it in Partially Observed settings in Reinforcement learning.
Although, along the way I kind of enjoyed studying this and implemented some stuff.

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of :
1. [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Word%20embeddings)
2. [Character level language modelling of Pokemon names](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Language%20Models/Character%20level)
3. [Word level language modelling using Shakespeare's Sonnets](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Language%20Models/Word%20LM)


## Results

### 1. Word Embeddings



### 2. Language modelling on Pokemon names

Select examples of generated Pokemon names. 

acgaeria<br/>
iciraano<br/>
oteta <br/>
qilornoe<br/>
sitorenn<br/>
xyenrai<br/>
yaoraoni<br/>
zeronaar<br/>

Overall, the results were quite underwhelming. I think the main reason could be one/all of the below :
1. The dataset is just weird. I agree Pokemon names are really cool but they don't really follow any trend and are mostly random alphabets with some vowels here and there.
2. I was too impatient and didn't train long enough (also quite plausible)

### 3. Language modelling on Shakespeare's Sonnets

 morning it self to my love <br/>
 you as the sun and make war <br/>
 with me and beauty â€™ s own <br/>
 in thy love and this huge we <br/>
 desire of thee my self thy beauty <br/>
 of thy beauty still weep that is <br/>
 so thou art so should look in <br/>
 the time that thou art twice in <br/>
 love is the day and in your <br/>
 own hand takes from you should my<br/> 
 self thy self with his beauty and <br/>
 in my mind that which steals a <br/>
 little of my mind and in thy <br/>
 sweet semblance to be a woman

 I was honestly really impressed with these results, given I trained only for 15 epochs. I think it captured some important relationships between words.
