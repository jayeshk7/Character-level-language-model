# Intro to NLP
 
This has codes for everything I implemented while trying to study NLP.<br/>
*There's a separate ReadMe in each folder*

This repository contains **PyTorch** implementation of :
1. [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Word%20embeddings)
2. [Character level language modelling using Pokemon names](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Language%20Models/Character%20level)
3. [Word level language modelling using Shakespeare's Sonnets](https://github.com/jayeshk7/Intro-to-NLP/tree/master/Language%20Models/Word%20LM)
